# Vision Extended xLSTM: An Innovative Approach for Plant Leaf Disease Identification with Limited Training Samples

## Abstract

Identifying plant leaf diseases accurately and timely is crucial for ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture. Traditional visual inspection methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision offer promising solutions, but these often struggle with limited training data and the complexity of disease symptoms. This paper proposes a novel hybrid classification model called Vision Extended xLSTM, which integrates multiscale feature fusion and attention methods. By applying a stack of alternating mLSTM blocks and concatenating frequency domain and spatial vision features, the model achieves a prominent fusion of disease-relevant information. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Vision Extended xLSTM model significantly outperforms existing deep learning and transformer-based models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even with limited training samples (10%). The superior performance and generalizability of the proposed approach underscore its potential to revolutionize plant disease identification in real-world agricultural scenarios.
